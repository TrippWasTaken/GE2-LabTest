# AI Pathfinding
There are 10 “traffic lights” arranged in a circle of radius 10 centred around the origin (0,0,0). Each traffic light cycles through green, yellow (blue in my case as Im colorblind) and red and then back to green again. Traffic lights stay green for a random time of between 5 and 10 seconds. Traffic lights go blue for exactly 4 seconds always. Traffic lights stay red for a random time of between 5 and 10 seconds and then go back to green again. When the program starts, each traffic light is set to be red, yellow or green randomly. The “car” picks a green traffic light to go to at random. It should only ever go to a green traffic light. When it arrives at a green traffic light it should pick another green traffic light to arrive at. If the traffic light it's heading for turns yellow or red when it's on the way, it should pick a different traffic light to go to.
